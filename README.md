# Alien Invasion — 2D Arcade Shooting Game

Alien Invasion is a Python-based arcade game where the player controls a spaceship to defend Earth from waves of alien attacks.  
The objective is to destroy incoming alien fleets while avoiding collisions and preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen.  
The game becomes progressively challenging as speed and difficulty increase with each level.
